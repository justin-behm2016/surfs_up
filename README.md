## Overview
The overview of this analysis was to collect weather data for an investor looking to open a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, this analysis pertained to the months of June and December. These two months were looked into to determine whether the weather in Oahu would allow for a year-round surf shop to be a sustainable business venture.

The image above displays a variety of statistics in regards to weather in December.

* There are several key differences and similarities between the two months. One of the first that stands out is the similarity in max temperature. In the data, June's max temperature is 85 degrees, while December's max temperature is 83 degrees. Given the lack of differentiation between these two values, it appears that June doesn't get to be too hot for customers to enjoy surfing and ice cream. Additionally, there are still days in December with similar heat to June, allowing for the continuation of ice cream sales during this month.

* A second data point worth looking into is the minimum temperature for both months. December's minimum temperature is 56 degrees and June's minimum temperature is 64 degrees. Given that both months get to lower temperatures, the inclusion of a hot item, such as hot chocolate, in an ice-cream shop's menu could be financially beneficial year-round. The 8-point differential between the two months suggests that hot chocolate sales could be greater in December, but still significant in June.

* The final data point that stands out is the similarity in mean temperature between the two months. June's mean temperature is approximately 75 degrees, while December's mean temperature is approximately 71 degrees. The similarity between these two mean values suggests that the climate of Oahu doesn't vary enough to suggest that a year-round surf and ice cream shop would be anything other than a sustainable business venture.

#### Summary
Given the data between both months, it appears that the weather in Oahu does not vary significantly enough to ruin the investor's business venture. There is a large amount of similarity between factors like mean temperature and minimum or maximum temperature. However, before moving forward I would suggest several other weather inqueries. For example, I would suggest looking into precipitation amounts and frequency of precipitation between both months. Additionally, I would consider exploring data around tide-levels of nearby surfing locations in both months. Finally, I recommend comparing average sunset and sunrise times to maximize profitability by adjusting hours of operation of the shop.
